# Open Weather
This is a simple project that I have created to apply what I have learned from [Envato's Retrofit 2 tutorial](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-retrofit-2--cms-27792?utm_source=Android+Weekly&utm_campaign=aa29d184f9-Android_Weekly_236&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4eb677ad19-aa29d184f9-338107301).
It uses Retrofit 2 and gson to retrieve weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](www.openweathermap.org) and logs the results.

## Instructions
Add to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties:
  `MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="WEATHER-API-KEY"` (found at https://home.openweathermap.org/)
